# JustKits
A basic plugin for 1.16 Spigot that 'just adds kits'.

This is not meant for regular use and is solely for my own education. I recommend a more feature-rich 'kits plug-in' made by an experienced developer.

Anyways, here's how to use it:

1. Download the latest release
2. Drag and drop the .jar file into your 'plugins' folder
3. Run your server once so the config.yml file can be generated
4. Open config.yml and add your own custom kits based on the examples given in the config
5. To set up permissions, simply use 'JustKits.kit.nameofyourkithere' as the permission for the kit.
6. Launch your server and use '/kits' to view all of your available kits. Use '/kit [kit name]' to recieve the items of a kit.
